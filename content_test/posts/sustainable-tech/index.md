Technology plays a crucial role in addressing climate change and promoting environmental sustainability.

## Renewable Energy Tech

- Solar panel efficiency improvements
- Advanced battery storage systems
- Smart grid technologies

## Carbon Tracking Apps

Mobile applications that help individuals and businesses monitor and reduce their carbon footprint.

## IoT for Conservation

Internet of Things devices monitoring wildlife, deforestation, and water quality in real-time.

```python
# Carbon footprint calculator example
def calculate_carbon_footprint(energy_usage, transportation, waste):
    # Simplified calculation
    carbon = (energy_usage * 0.5) + (transportation * 0.3) + (waste * 0.2)
    return carbon
```

By leveraging technology, we can create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
