As we enter 2026, artificial intelligence continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Here are some key trends shaping the industry:

## 1. Multimodal AI
Combining text, image, and audio processing for more comprehensive understanding.

## 2. Edge Computing Integration
Bringing AI capabilities closer to the data source for faster, more efficient processing.

## 3. Ethical AI Frameworks
Increased focus on responsible AI development and deployment.

```python
# Example of a simple AI model
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

These trends promise to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to transportation.
